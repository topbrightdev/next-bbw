Over 36\n  years later, the locally-owned family business has grown, while members of\n  the founding family are still active and involved every day.\n    \n    The story began when the family moved from Texas to Seattle. Shortly\n  thereafter, they decided that they’d start a business making chicken like\n  they used to back home in Texas.\n    \n    Lewis Rudd and Faye Stephens saw their mission as simple: Provide FRESH and\n  high-quality chicken and GOOD homemade side dishes, served with casual and\n  courteous service.\n    \n    After waiting six years for funding, the family opened the first store on\n  February 3, 1984 in Seattle’s Central District at 501 23rd Avenue, across from\n  Garfield High School. Since then, they have built the family business into a\n  Pacific Northwest icon.",
